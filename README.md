# deep-learning-bio-mechanic-movemement-detector
deep Learning part of my Itc movement detector.

This repository is meant to showcase my part of the movemement-detector project and is not usable since I did not include the data we mined and generated . nor does it include the pre trained models (openpose) that we used on a small part of the project.
